# DOOM Reinforcement Learning Agents

**ðŸš§Work in progressðŸš§**

In this repository, I attempt to use reinforcement learning techniques learnt in class to create agents that can play simulations of DOOM 1993. The task is simple: survive and defeat enemies.

**Techniques I plan to explore:**

1. Q-learning
2. Deep Q-Networks
3. Proximal Policy Optimization
